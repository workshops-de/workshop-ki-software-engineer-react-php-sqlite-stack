## Overview

Use prompt engineering and an AI agent to produce a living architecture summary for the Bookmonkey codebase (Next.js frontend + PHP/SQLite backend), then reflect on limits and risks of that workflow.

---

- **Let AI explain the architecture:** Ask your agent to explain the tech stack, the dependencies, and the architecture of both `app/frontend` (Next.js) and `app/backend` (PHP/Slim + SQLite). The agent shall write a summary saved as `ARCHITECTURE.md` next to `README.md`. Link that summary from `README.md`.

---

- **This is important:** Imagine you join an existing project. You usually start by reading code, searching for known or recurring patterns, folder by folder. The chance to miss something is high: the human brain rarely has the attention span to thoroughly review a whole enterprise-scale tree. Here is where AI can be a handy co-worker.

---

- **But wait —** What could possibly be wrong with this approach? Discuss this topic in the group.

*💡 Come up with your own prompt. If you are stuck and do not know how to start, check the hint for an example.*
