## Overview

Add an interactive map and learn to **state hard technical constraints up front** so the agent
doesn't head down a dead end. A map is a client-only, interactive component in an otherwise
server-rendered app — telling the agent that constraint first is context-engineering applied to
implementation.

## Prerequisites

- Recommended: `agent-browser` (visually validate the interactive map), `frontend-design`
- No dedicated skill covers Leaflet — use the docs below.

## Background

The map uses Leaflet with OpenStreetMap tiles. Because Leaflet touches the browser's window and
DOM, it cannot be server-rendered; it must be loaded dynamically, client-side only, inside a client
component. If you don't tell the agent this constraint, it may attempt a server-rendered approach
and waste a loop discovering the problem. For Bookmonkey, a natural use is showing which
**bookstores** near a location carry a given **book**.

## Steps

1. Before implementing, tell the agent the **constraint** clearly: the map is interactive and
   client-only, and must be loaded dynamically without server rendering. Ask it to plan within
   that constraint.
2. Implement a map with **distinct markers** for your two main entity types (e.g. books currently
   available nearby and bookstores), and popups that link to the corresponding detail pages.
3. Add a **location picker**: when creating or editing a bookstore, let the user choose a point on
   the map and capture its coordinates, then send them to the PHP backend to persist.
4. Integrate the map into the relevant screens without breaking the rest of the app.
5. Verify interactively: markers appear, popups link correctly, and picking a location stores the
   right coordinates via the backend.
6. Reflect on how stating the constraint first changed the agent's approach.

## Success Criteria

- [ ] An interactive map renders with distinct markers for each entity type
- [ ] Marker popups link through to the relevant detail pages
- [ ] A location picker captures coordinates when creating/editing and persists them via the
      backend
- [ ] The map loads client-only (dynamic import, no SSR); `npm run build` passes
