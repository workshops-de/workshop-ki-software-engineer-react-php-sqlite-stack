# Agents & Skills

## Fine grained task delegation

layout: why

# Why this topic matters

Developers face the challenge of working with AI while ensuring quality; rules with the right structure make delegation easier and more effective.

- Each developer faces the challenge to work with AI, but the quality needs to be ensured
- Developers must understand how to delegate tasks they normally do manually
- Rules are very easy and with the correct structure they can help a lot

# What is it?

An instruction provides reusable and precise context to a model to improve the quality of the LLM's output.

# Vendor-specific files

::left::

- **.cursorrules**, **claude.md**, Copilot instructions — same concept, differ in detail
- Messy to maintain if a team uses different setups
- Manageable especially with AI support

::right::

description: Use TypeScript strict mode
globs: ['**/*.ts', '**/*.tsx']

Prefer explicit types over inference for public APIs.
Use functional patterns where possible.

# AGENTS.md

layout: two-cols-header
layoutClass: gap-4

# Emerging standard: AGENTS.md

::left::

- Open format: [agents.md](https://agents.md/) — many vendors support it
- Typical sections: project overview, build and test commands, code style guidelines, testing instructions, security considerations

::right::

<WindowMockup codeblock title="AGENTS.md" padding="1rem">

```md
# AGENTS.md

## Setup commands

- Start dev: `pnpm dev`
- Run tests: `pnpm test`

## Code style

- TypeScript strict mode
- Single quotes, no semicolons
```

# AGENTS.md — what to put in

- **Project overview** — what the repo does, main entry points
- **Build and test commands** — how to install, run, test
- **Code style guidelines** — formatting, naming, patterns
- **Testing instructions** — how to run and extend tests
- **Security considerations** — secrets, permissions, deployment

# Nested AGENTS.md

::left::

- Multiple AGENTS.md files can live in one project
- The agent reads the **nearest** file in the directory tree (closest takes precedence)
- Example: OpenAI repo has 88 AGENTS.md files; each subproject can ship tailored instructions

::right::

<WindowMockup codeblock title="project/" padding="1rem">

```text
project/
├── AGENTS.md           # Root: global context
├── shipment/
│   └── AGENTS.md       # Domain: shipment
├── payment/
│   └── AGENTS.md       # Domain: payment
└── inventory/
    └── AGENTS.md       # Domain: inventory
```

</WindowMockup>

Nearest AGENTS.md to the edited file wins — each domain gets tailored instructions.

# Scope of rules

---
layout: default
---

# Where rules apply

- **Global** — loaded for the whole workspace (e.g. .cursor/rules)
- **Per chat** — mention a rule file by name (e.g. @filename) in the conversation
- **Commands** — many vendors support **Commands** (e.g. `/create-pr`, `/interview`, `/commit`): one instruction per concrete task
- Goal: fine-grained control and custom workflows

---
layout: default
---

# Evolution: from “god rule” to task-oriented

- **Before:** One big file with everything — coding guidelines, architecture, conventions
- **Now:** Think in **tasks** and steps; improve the development process with focused rules
- Use Commands for: **interview → develop → test → finalise** — each step has its own instruction and puts the developer in the loop to review and tune the prompt

Delegate repeating tasks. You are the expert. The agent offers opportunities. Some of them might be a surprise.
</Callout>

<!--
| Step      | Purpose                           |
| --------- | --------------------------------- |
| Interview | Gather requirements, clarify      |
| Develop   | Implement with clear instructions |
| Test      | Run checks, fix failures          |
| Finalise  | Commit, PR, review                |

Each rule file or command supports one step and keeps the developer in the loop.

# ⚠️ Beware generated rules!

## You need to own the rules.

# Two sides of the same coin

::left::

**Generated rules** — productivity impact

<div v-click>

1. **~28% longer** runtime (vs. repos with hand-crafted instructions)
2. **~17% more** output tokens (less focused, higher cost)
3. **REASON**: Replicate existing content and amplify it; **no vision**, no sense of what is already misused

</div>

::right::

**Your own rules** (e.g. AGENTS.md)

<div v-click>

- Research: agents **~28% faster**, **~17% fewer** output tokens
- Make rules your own; describe the **best version** of your project
- **Put yourself in the loop**

# Tip

- Make rules **your own**
- Instruct agents to be **very critical** about the provided content
- Describe the **best version** of your project instead of taking existing things for granted
- **Put yourself in the loop**

<br><br>

<Callout type="important" v-click>
Rules are typically loaded once when the agent is initialized. If you edit a rule file, prompt the agent to read that file again (e.g. by @-mentioning it).
